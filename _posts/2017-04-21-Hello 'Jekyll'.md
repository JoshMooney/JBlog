## Hello World and Hello Jekyll

This is my first actual blog post on my Jekyll "Blog". I'll be using this space as a place to document new projects, ideas
and maybe even tutorials around writing code. 
> "Its a great idea for a programmer, especially one thats involved in game to maintain a blog, it doesn't have to be pretty or cost anything. Just a place to show off you." -Paneler at Galway Hackaton 

I'm sorry guy from Galway Hackaton but your name slips my mind, I participated in the Galway Hackaton sponsored by Microsoft well over a year ago and these words 
still have stuck with me. I appreshate the importance of a Blog to show off ME and my thought process when problem solving, but have gotten very lazy lately 
. Opening Wordpress to churn out another blog post was difficult so I came to the conclusion that anyone can make a wordpress, a monkey could fill out the form and meet 
the requirments now a days. I felt it would speak alot more to my character and to my ablity as a programmer to make a website from the ground up, make it my way I want and 
host it online.

Now for anyone who hasn't met me I AM NOT A WEB DEVELOPER! Infact I have very little networking experience but find this an interesting challege and good knowledge to have under
 my belt. This would be a good oppertunity to introduce myself. 
 
 Hi, my name is Josh. {Picture ??} 
 
 Im a 22 year old what feels like fresh out of college, infact I've been out of college coming up on
 a year this May. The reason it feels so fresh is, like alot of my peers; found it horribly difficult to get any kind of employment. After completing a 4 year Game Development course
 at [Instute of Technoly Carlow](ITC Link) achieveing a Second Class First Honor, I went on the prowl for a job. For the first 3 months or so I was exclusivly looking for game development
 jobs but this being Ireland there isn't really a market here for it. Then I expanded my seach parameters to anything software related and after applying for close to 60 jobs in one month 
 I moved onto any kind of job because I was board of sitting around. I managed to find a job working in a all digital casino in Dun Laoghaire only 20 minutes from my home. The hours were 
 shift work meaning day shift 9am-5pm(Brillant) or 5pm-3am(Not so much), I met some fantastic people working there both staff and memebers, the dayly face to face also helped me get over 
 alot of things like fear of confrontation, angisity meeting new people and a mix of terror and angisty making small talk with aquatences.
 
 6 months past like a flash and I continued to look for a job in my field a job to progress my career. Thanks to the help of a friend from college who I don't know if its ok to name but I'm 
 going to do it anyway Alex. I got an interview, the first interview. The job was a software developer in a small tech company down in Cork called [Digisoft.tv]() who specialize in developing 
 software related to and for TV. After what I felt was a fantastic interview I was told "You will hear from us after the new year", it being December 19th I saw no issue with that. I waited, and waited
  and waited eagerly to hear back. I didn't! so I continued still thinking I could hear from the job every week that passed I lost alittle more hope and every week I held myself back from emailing 
  them looking for feedback or a update on the position but was warned this is never a good idea. If an employer is interested in you they will get in contact with you, not the other way around.
