Ok so full discloser, before I went to this meetup I had never even heard of "Uncle" Bob before. 

The name didn't resonate with me in the slightest, most of the other big names in the tech industry I wouldn't dare claim to know off by heart, but there is certain names and faces 
that if you showed me I would come out with something like: "Oh yeah thats the guy that created <Insert import moment in computer history here>". Still in light of that I did a quick 
Google and decided I'd make an appearence, whats the worse thing that comes from it ?

A brief history lession for those of you that would of been in the same boat as me. Robert C. Martin or better know in the software engineering world as Unlce Bob is a software 
developer turn author who has successfully published some of the best known books in our industry as well as being a co-author to the Agile Manifesto. 
Books such as:

<br>
<h3>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</h3>

"Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because 
of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way." As this book focuses on the code itself teaching the best agile practice of cleaning code.

<h3>The Clean Coder</h3>

"Programmers who endure and succeed amidst swirling uncertainty and nonstop pressure share a common attribute: They care deeply about the practice of creating software. They treat 
it as a craft. They are professionals" This book focuses closer on the habits of the programmer and explaining what he thinks are the expectation for a professional programmer on 
management interactions, time management, pressure, on collaboration, and on the choice of tools to use. This book particallry interests me and as of this moment is on my Amazon 
watch list.

<h3>Agile Principles, Patterns and Practices in C#</h3>

"Robert C. Martin helped bring Agile principles to tens of thousands of Java and C++ programmers. Now .NET programmers have a definitive guide to agile methods with this completely 
updated volume from Robert C. Martin and Micah Martin". Exactly as it says on the tin this book teaches what would have been a relitivily new idea of agile to C# developers.

Now Uncle Bob runs his own consulting firm called _Unlce Bob Consulting LLC_ and Clean Coders which hosts videos based on his experiences and books.

<h3>The Meetup</h3>
Now that you know who uncle bob is now we can talk about his Meetup, I arrived just as the talk was starting and found a nice little place to hide out down the back worried about being
put in the spot light and being asked a question, this being my first Meetup experience, I didn't know what to expect. Turns out there was nothing to be afraid of, this was a 
gathering of like minded people here to talk about there field and what interests them. I can safely say I thoroughly enjoyed it, the meetup began with a history of software 
engineering given from the perspective of Robert, someone who has been around "since the start" in his own words. 

We discussed the origin of computers, paper programming

invention of C++ Unix

the invention of Agile

some interesting thoughts every 5 year new devs

state of the industry now

I would recommend going to hear Robert Martin talk he is an inspiring engineer and after listening to him talk I really felt myself charged and ready to take on the world after all
we do rule the world!
