Ok so full discloser, before I went to this meetup I had never even heard of "Uncle" Bob before. 

The name didn't resonate with me in the slightest, most of the other big names in the tech industry I wouldn't dare claim to know off by heart, but there is certain names and faces 
that if you showed me I would come out with something like: "Oh yeah thats the guy that created <Insert import moment in computer history here>". Still in light of that I did a quick 
Google and decided I'd make an appearence, whats the worse thing that comes from it ?

A brief history lession for those of you that would of been in the same boat as me. Robert C. Martin or better know in the software engineering world as Unlce Bob is a software 
developer turn author who has successfully published some of the best known books in our industry as well as being a co-author to the Agile Manifesto. 
Books such as:

<h3>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</h3>

"Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because 
of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way." As this book focuses on the code itself teaching the best agile practice of cleaning code.

<h3>The Clean Coder</h3>

"Programmers who endure and succeed amidst swirling uncertainty and nonstop pressure share a common attribute: They care deeply about the practice of creating software. They treat 
it as a craft. They are professionals" This book focuses closer on the habits of the programmer and explaining what he thinks are the expectation for a professional programmer on 
management interactions, time management, pressure, on collaboration, and on the choice of tools to use. This book particallry interests me and as of this moment is on my Amazon 
watch list.

<h3>Agile Principles, Patterns and Practices in C#</h3>

"Robert C. Martin helped bring Agile principles to tens of thousands of Java and C++ programmers. Now .NET programmers have a definitive guide to agile methods with this completely 
updated volume from Robert C. Martin and Micah Martin". Exactly as it says on the tin this book teaches what would have been a relitivily new idea of agile to C# developers.

Now Uncle Bob runs his own consulting firm called _Unlce Bob Consulting LLC_ and Clean Coders which hosts videos based on his experiences and books.

<h3>The Meetup</h3>
Now that you know who uncle bob is now we can talk about his Meetup, I arrived just as the talk was starting and found a nice little place to hide out down the back worried about being
put in the spot light and being asked a question, this being my first Meetup experience, I didn't know what to expect. Turns out there was nothing to be afraid of, this was a 
gathering of like minded people here to talk about there field and what interests them. I can safely say I thoroughly enjoyed it, the meetup began with a history of software 
engineering given from the perspective of Robert, someone who has been around "since the start" in his own words. 

We discussed the origin of computers, what was the first computer and how far we have come. Robert told us how he used to paper program which involved something like Punch cards to write code. How it would work was the engineer would write out the code onto specially printed table like chats. They would then give it to one of the operators that would take the paper based code and type it out into a computer. This process could take days, a typical scenario would be the developer would write all his code on Monday and give in his scripts. This would then be pushed onto the pile of scripts the operators had to type up. Whenever the program has been typed up it is then run on a computer and the output is printed out. The programmer would then expect to see a turn around of about a week before getting to test and run his code. Then correcting for bugs, errors and spelling mistakes.

We briefly touched down on NAMES  HERE the brilliant minds behind the creation of C++, C and Unix we owe most of our advancements in the computer development industry to these inventions as well as the concept of Object Orientated Development which NAMES also helped bring to the forfront of the IT industry

Computing is still a relatively new field only really being invented back in the 1940's. So we made plenty of mistakes along the way to learn the right ways of doing things and the wrong ways. One of these wrong ways was Waterfall. Developers at the time had nothing better it was the defacto way of developing software. Today Waterfall is considered barbaric to modern developers but this was how code was written until Robert, NAME and some other leading figures in the industry decided to hold a conference. Originally it was called NAME but most people would know it as the birthplace of Alige development. These like most developers where sick and tired of poor standards leading to poor and unmaintainible code so they invent a new development process called Agile. MORE INFO NEEDED

30 years ago there might of only been a couple hundred developers in the world. Off the top of his head Robert calculated the growth in computer developers.has been growning exponentially rather than linearly and determined the average growth of the pool of knowledge doubles every 4-5 years. This means the number of developers doubles every 5 years which is an amazing fact but the part that really got through to me was that this means every 5 years half of all developers have less than 5 years experience.meaning we don't have enough seniors we don't have enough man power to train in all these people so something will have to change about the training and promotion of new developers. See

Then wrapping the whole talk up Robert brought forward the idea of bad code nowadays and how there is more developers now than there ever has been. We need to take responsibility for our code, we need to hold ourselves to a standard. This will happen eventually if we like it or not. But the only way of securing and safly preserving our field without outside interference is to get together and put forward these set of rules ourselves rather than our govermnets deciding it for us when legisation comes round this is the same thing that happened years back with the medical industry they were being regulated by the government, then demanding a set of rules to be put in place rather than let the less informed make decisions about things they know little to nothing about. The industry stepped forward with the mediacl journal NAME which outlines a clear set of guidelines and rules a medical professional must follow.

We will need similar rules and similarly it of course will be best if we are the ones to out them in place.

I would recommend going to hear Robert Martin talk he is an inspiring engineer and after listening to him talk I really felt myself charged and ready to take on the world after all
we do rule the world!
