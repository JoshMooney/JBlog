I know in my last post, consequently my first post i promised a constant flow of blogging from there on out but upon going back to college in January everything got very hectic quickly. The third sprint began before we even knew it, literally we lost nearly 2 weeks of the 4 we have assigned to it due to miss communication between the lecturers and schedule. I was not doing nothing in this time though as i had a AI Asteroid project to do which I will do a separate blog post on soon.
<h2>Crunch time began</h2>
The reason I haven't been very active on my blog is because of the sheer amount of crunch time i was lashing out. The last two weeks have been full 9a.m. - 9p.m. days in college and getting home to consume whatever food was around before falling into bed and doing it all again. I'm aware crunch time is just apart of this industry and was quiet happy with myself because i actually managed to get quiet a lot done. Don't take my word for it take a look at the video i threw together before getting on the bus and writing this blog post:

I managed to get nearly everything i set out to do for the sprint which included:
<ul>
	<li>Re-scaled Box2D world.</li>
	<li>Player Sprite</li>
	<li>Enemy Sprite</li>
	<li>Base Class Enemy</li>
	<li>Skeleton AI</li>
	<li>Loading and saving Game from .xml using tinyXML</li>
	<li>Implement and Utilize THOR SFML extension</li>
	<li>Animated Player</li>
	<li>Animated Skeleton</li>
	<li>Box2D Contact Listeners</li>
	<li>Box2D Debug Draw</li>
	<li>Spawner class</li>
	<li>Generate Enemies from .tmx</li>
	<li>Crumbling Block (3Variants + 2Sizes)</li>
	<li>Generate Block from .tmx</li>
	<li>Player Combat</li>
</ul>
Although i did get a lot done the crunch time did take a lot out of me. I intend my weekend to be spent in bed catching up on some much missed sleep. Unfortunately I did not get everything done i set out to do done I choose to focus my time into key features i know i can gain marks for and such Box2D Collision Filtering and Expanded Options menu where not high priority. They will be pushed back onto my sprint 3b.
<h2>Real World Modeling</h2>
RWM project 3 begins on monday. For anyone unsure of what RWM is its simple its a large scale group based project where classes are put on hold and instead it is required of us to work in teams of 4-5 people and attend college 9-5 to work on a single project, where we must collaborate and use our knowledge base to create a game which satisfies a list of requirements of the assignment.

During this time we consult with the students in Carlow IT Wicklow Campus visual design course and collaborate with them as we will program the game and they will provide the art and animation as part of an assignment with there college degrees. Usually these RWM projects go on for about a week and can be super challenging to get everyone cooperating and doing there work. This RWM is an excision of that formula as it is a month long and is called project ARGO the details have not been too clear but we are aware ARGO represents the 4 subjects with a marking continuous assessment grade dedicated to a section of it .

A - Artifical Intelligence
R- Real World Modelling
G- Games Enginnering
O - Online Gaming Technolgy

So the next month is going to be pretty tough getting Project ARGO up and running and off the ground, I will also be using any free time i do have to continue working on my FYP and chip away from it slowly. So encase i don't post again soon you are all aware of the kind of hell I'm in.
