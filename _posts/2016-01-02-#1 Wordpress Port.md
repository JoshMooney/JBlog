Its a new year and its a new me, Yada yada the usual new years waffle people tent to feed themselves and others. I have been meaning to start this blog for quite sometime. During my 3rd year of college their was a lot of talk about how important a blog can be to  programmer for both mental and career enhancements. It will allow me to track issues, errors and bugs in my programming and show the process I take of side stepping or solving these issues. For employers it can help give a better picture of what kind of person and programmer I am.

I have been meaning to start this for quiet a while and as a new year resolution I hope to keep the blog updated weekly with programming advice, outlooks on the industry, progress in college and what I am up to lately.

Over the last few months we have each been working on individual Final Year Projects (FYP). This is my sprint 2 progress update video that was a requirement as part of the submission process. I shared it to Facebook originally but think this is a more appropriate place for it.

I have written it in C++ and SFML. I used external libraries such as [Box2D](http://box2d.org/downloads/) which is light weight 2D physics engine and [STP](https://github.com/edoren/STP)a SFML Tiled Parser for decompressing and reading .tmx files. There are few restrictions to this project it is just a matter of meeting certain requirements for grading purposes that can be found [here](https://www.google.ie/) if anyone was interested in where this project must arrive at before the end of the college term and final submission which is in May (2016) sometime.

For now I will keep it short and sweet and finish up here. Next post I hope to talk about my Artificial Intelligence (AI) project where I am implementing algorithms such as Flocking, Seeking and Swarming. I will research into how to insert code snippets with word press to help give some insight into my issues and solutions.

Wishing everyone a happy new year and good luck with the year to come.
